## üöÄ SYNOPSIS

The `pipex` project at 42 school challenges students to craft a program emulating the intricacies of shell command pipelines in the C language.

This endeavor necessitates a deep comprehension of process creation, manipulation, and input/output redirection. Students are tasked with orchestrating a sequence of commands, efficiently directing the output of one command as the input for the next.

The project not only hones skills in managing processes but also delves into the nuances of handling file descriptors and executing commands in a seamless chain.

Successfully completing pipex showcases a mastery of process manipulation and solidifies the understanding of pivotal system calls in Unix-like operating systems.
